### Folder Structure

```
guessinggame
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ modules
|

```

- **core:** Contains the code and rules shared between the app's features.
- **modules** Contains the code for each feature.

```

```
- **domain:** Contains repository abstractions and models (entities) representing the application's core data.

- **external:** Responsible for implementing external data sources and data access objects (DAOs).

- **infra:** This layer is responsible for the implementation of the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer. It acts as a bridge between the external data sources and the domain layer.

- **presentation:** Contains the code related to the user interface (UI) and controllers.
